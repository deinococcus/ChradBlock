These commands give you an idea where the new files should go to:
      ln -s `pwd`/AdBlock.h src/third_party/WebKit/WebCore/loader/
      ln -s `pwd`/AdBlock.cpp src/third_party/WebKit/WebCore/loader/
      ln -s `pwd`/AdBlockImpl.h src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/
      ln -s `pwd`/AdBlockImpl.cpp src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/
The patches are to be applied to Chromium's existing files.

Design:
The renderer before loading a url, sends the string via IPC to the
browser, which then queries the pre-built blacklist and tells the
renderer to block the request or not. An alternative is to simply
returns the handle of the blacklist file to the renderer, which does
the parsing and matching. This way we don't need to change the
original AdBlock code too much, but it also means every tab loads the
blacklist again and again.

TODO:
Support more advanced filter rules: http://adblockplus.org/en/filters
Support customization, ideally through extensions

Authors:
* ruth(f.c.s) (deinococcus.radiophilus@gmail.com): Implemented the first version
* Wei Hu <weihu@cs.virginia.edu>: Split AdBlock into two pieces in
  order to support sandbox properly. Refactored the string operations
  to rely on std and chromium code instead of webkit code. Fixed a few
  regular expression bugs (or so I hope).
